/*Aircrafts

Create a class that represents an aircraft
There are 2 types of aircrafts: F16 and F35
Both aircraft should track how many ammo it has

All the aircrafts should be created with empty ammo store
fight
It should use all the ammos (set it to 0) and it should return the damage it deals
The damage is the multiplication of the base damage and the ammos
refill
It should take a number as parameter and substract as much ammo as possibe
It can't have more ammo than the number or the max ammo
It should return the remaining ammo
Eg. Filling an empty F35 with 300 would completely fill the storage of the aircraft and would return the remaining 28
